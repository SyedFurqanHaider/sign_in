For your period of use of Preva you grant to Precor a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use this personal data, so long as such usage is in compliance with the Preva Privacy Policy.

You agree to abide by such other terms and conditions, including where applicable representing that you are of sufficient legal age to use or participate in such service or feature.

XIV. Limitation of Liability

EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE NEW JERSEY LAW, YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE USER SERVICES AND/OR OUR CONTENT IS TO STOP USING THE USER SERVICES AND/OR THE CONTENT. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE NEW JERSEY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE PRECOR PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (COLLECTIVELY, THE “EXCLUDED DAMAGES”), ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE USER SERVICES OR ANY OF THE CONTENT, INCLUDING: LOSS OF REVENUE, ANTICIPATED PROFITS, BUSINESS, SAVINGS, GOODWILL OR DATA; ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, DENIAL OF SERVICE, ATTACK, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OR COMPUTER VIRUS; OR THIRD PARTY THEFT OF, DESTRUCTION OF, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, ALTERATION OR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION, EQUIPMENT OR PROPERTY, EVEN IF THE PRECOR PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN THE EXCLUDED DAMAGES. FURTHER, AND EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE NEW JERSEY LAW, THE PRECOR PARTIES WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY, BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WITH THE TERMS OR WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE NEW JERSEY LAW, THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF: (I) ANY NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PRECOR PARTY OR (II) WHETHER THE LIABILITY SOUNDS IN NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LEGAL LIABILITY; AND WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURSIDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OR EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THOSE JURISDICTION, THE PRECOR PARTIES’ LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PRECOR PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100 USD).

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEW JERSEY: THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION IS INTENDED TO BE ONLY AS BROAD AND INCLUSIVE AS IS PERMITTED UNDER NEW JERSEY LAW. IF ANY PORTION OF THIS SECTION IS HELD TO BE INVALID UNDER NEW JERSEY LAW, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS SECTION.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE LIMITS OR EXCLUDES OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES OR DAMAGES CAUSED BY PRECOR’S OWN FRAUD, RECKLESSNESS, GROSS NEGLEGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

XV. Indemnification

Except as prohibited by applicable New Jersey law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Precor Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising from or related to your use of the User Services and/or any content thereof.

XVI. Termination

You acknowledge and agree that Precor may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the User Services at any time, with or without cause, in Precor’s absolute discretion and without notice, including for any breach of the Terms. The relevant version of the Terms shall continue to apply to all prior use of the User Services. The following paragraphs of the Terms shall survive termination of your use or access to the User Services: paragraphs concerning indemnification, disclaimers, limitations of liability, termination and general provisions and any other provision that by its terms survives termination of your use of or access to the User Services.

XVII. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

This Section applies to any dispute EXCEPT THAT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, PRECOR’S, OR EITHER OF OUR LICENSOR’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. "Dispute" means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Precor concerning Preva, the User Services, this Agreement, or any product or service offered, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. "Dispute" will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.

a. Notice of Dispute.     In the event of a dispute, you or Precor must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute to our registered agent CT Corporation System, 505 Union Avenue SE, Suite 120, Olympia, WA 98501. Precor will send any Notice of Dispute to you to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your e-mail address. You and Precor will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or Precor may commence arbitration.

b. Small Claims Court.     You may also litigate any dispute in small claims court in your county of residence or King County, Washington, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.

c. Binding Arbitration.     IF YOU AND PRECOR DO NOT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY INFORMAL NEGOTIATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ANY OTHER EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.

d. Class Action Waiver.     ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR PRECOR WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.

e. Arbitration Procedure.     Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and in many cases its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent CT Corporation System, 505 Union Avenue SE, Suite 120, Olympia, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $5,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Precor will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

f. Claims or Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year.     To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute relating to Preva, the User Services, this Agreement, or any product or service offered must be filed within one year in small claims court (Section XVII.b.), an arbitration proceeding (Section XVII.c.). The one-year period begins when the event giving rise to the claim first arose or when the Notice of Dispute was filed, whichever occurs earlier. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.

g. Severability.     If the class action waiver in Section XVII.d. is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then Section XVII will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section XVII is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of Section XVII remaining in full force and effect.

XVIII. General Provisions

a. Interpreting the Contract.     All parts of this Agreement apply to the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law; you may have greater rights in your jurisdiction of residence. If it is determined that we can’t enforce a part of this Agreement as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of this Agreement won’t change. Section XVII.g. says what happens if parts of Section XVII (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable, and prevails over this Section XVIII.a. if inconsistent with it. Other terms may apply if you purchase products or services from other Precor websites.

b. Assignment.     We may assign, transfer or otherwise dispose our rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign this Agreement or transfer any rights under it.

c. No Third-Party Beneficiaries.     This Agreement is solely for your and our benefit. It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors and assigns.

d. No Waiver.     Failure by Precor to enforce any provision(s) of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.

e. Governing Law.     The Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Washington will govern this User Agreement, without giving effect to any principals of conflict of laws. All claims and disputes arising out of this Agreement or the User Services, other than action for specific performance or injunctive relief brought by Precor, shall be exclusively brought in the federal, state, or local courts located in Seattle, Washington, USA and, with regard to such claims and disputes, you hereby irrevocably (i) submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over you by those courts and (ii) waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.

f. Entire Agreement.     This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Precor with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreement not specifically incorporated herein.

This Agreement was written in English (US).  To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Use conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.

Amer Sports group companies. You acknowledge and agree that we may share your personal data within Amer Sports group companies, and that we may transfer your personal data to be used by other Amer Sports group companies.

Service providers and other authorised third parties. We may transfer your personal data to authorised third parties that process personal data on behalf of Amer Sports for the purposes described in this Policy, such as for example, technical, logistics and other service providers. Such parties are not permitted to use your personal data for any other purposes than what your personal data was collected for, and we require them to act consistently with applicable laws and this Policy, as well as to use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data.

We may also transfer your personal data, including heart rate data, biometrical data or other health-related data, to a service partner, if you use such services where a third-party company needs to process such data for the provision of the respective service or where you separately agree that a third-party company may process your data in connection with the services or products of Amer Sports.

International transfers. Our products and services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore, your personal data may be transferred outside the country where you use our services, including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), where the level of data protection may not be deemed adequate by the European Commission. In such cases, we take steps to ensure that adequate protection for your personal data is provided as required by applicable laws. For international transfers of your personal data, we generally rely on agreements that are based on the “Standard Contractual Clauses” (“SCCs”) of the European Commission. You may find the SCCs  here. If you wish to know more about international transfers of your personal data, you may contact us via the contact details given below.

Other disclosures. We may disclose and otherwise process your personal data in accordance with applicable laws to defend the legitimate interests of Amer Sports, for example, in civil or criminal legal proceedings.

Mergers and acquisitions. If we decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganise our businesses in certain countries, this may involve us disclosing personal data to prospective or actual purchasers and their advisers, or receiving personal data from sellers and their advisers, for the purposes of such transactions.


DATA CONCERNING MINORS

Amer Sports does not seek to collect any information from or to engage in any transactions with persons under the legal age in their respective country. Our databases may nevertheless contain personal data of children due to the fact that it is not always possible to determine precisely the age of the user. We reserve the right to block the service from any person who is or whom we reasonably suspect of being a minor.

The policy of Amer Sports is to request that minors do not make purchases or engage in other legal acts regarding our products and services without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you are a minor but have the consent of your legal guardian, you must be able to prove that such consent exists upon request.


DATA QUALITY AND RETENTION

We take reasonable steps to keep the personal data that we possess accurate and up to date, and to delete out-of-date or otherwise incorrect or unnecessary personal data.

Certain Amer Sports products and services may allow you to manage your profile and the information in such a profile. We encourage you to access your personal data via your profile from time to time to ensure that it is correct and up to date. Please remember that for such electronic services where you may manage your profile, it is your responsibility to provide us with correct details, as well as to update the personal data that you have provided us with in case of any changes.

We store your personal data only for a period necessary for the purpose in question or as long as is required by applicable laws.


DATA SECURITY

Amer Sports implements appropriate technical and organisational security measures to prevent and minimise risks associated with providing and processing personal data.

Such security measures include, where appropriate, the use of firewalls, secure server facilities, encryption, implementing proper access rights management systems and processes, careful selection of processors, sufficient training of Amer Sports’ personnel involved in the processing and other necessary measures to provide appropriate protection for your personal data against unauthorised use or disclosure. Where appropriate, we may also take backup copies and use other such means to prevent accidental damage or destruction of your personal data. If a particular part of an Amer Sports website supports online transactions, we will use an industry standard security measure, such as the one available through “Secure Sockets Layer” (“SSL”), to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions.


USE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS

From time to time, when you visit an Amer Sports website, information may be placed on your computer to allow us to recognise your computer in the form of a text file known as a “cookie”. Our use of cookies is intended to provide benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session or the need to re-enter items that you placed in a shopping basket if you did not finish a transaction in a single visit. Cookies are also used for website traffic analysis and profiling.

Some of the Amer Sports websites may also use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. You may prevent Flash cookies from being stored by following the instructions provided by Adobe at http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.

Amer Sports may use so-called web beacons (or “pixel tags”) in connection with some websites. However, we do not use them to identify individual users personally. Web beacons are typically graphic images that are placed on a website and they are used to count visitors to a website and/or to access certain cookies. This information is used to improve our services. Web beacons do not typically collect any other information than what your browser provides us with as a standard part of any internet communication. If you turn off cookies, the web beacon will no longer be able to track your specific activity. The web beacon may, however, continue to collect information of visits from your IP address, but such information will no longer be personally identifiable.

If you wish to disable cookies or want to be notified before they are placed, you may do this in your browser settings. For example, if you are using Internet Explorer, you may disable and manage cookies by following the instructions here. However, we may not be able to provide certain services or you may not be able to view certain parts of this site if you have disabled cookies.

The content of some of our business partners that is linked to or from our website may also use cookies or web beacons. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

You acknowledge and agree to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices and to the access of such cookies, local storage technologies, beacons and information by us and by the third parties mentioned above.

YOUR RIGHTS

You have the right to request information and access to the personal data that we have collected from and of you. You also have the right to request that we replenish, rectify, anonymise or delete any incomplete, incorrect, unnecessary or outdated personal data that we hold on you. However, we cannot delete such personal data that is necessary for complying with binding legal obligations or if the personal data must be retained according to applicable laws. You have the right to request and receive the personal data that we have collected on you in a commonly used and machine-readable form. If you consider your personal data collected by us to be inaccurate, you do not wish your personal data to be deleted where the processing of your personal data has been deemed unlawful or the personal data is no longer necessary, or you have objected to the processing and the existence of legitimate grounds for processing is still under consideration, you may request restriction of processing of your personal data.

You may also at any time object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes, sending promotional materials, profiling or for the performance of market research. Furthermore, where your personal data is processed based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent for such processing at any time.

If you wish to make use of your rights mentioned above, you may, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable laws, exercise such rights by contacting us through the contact points referred to in the marketing materials or below in this Policy. In some cases, especially if you wish us to delete or cease the processing of your personal data, this may also mean that we may not be able to continue to provide the services to you. We encourage you to use available profile management tools for the above purposes as such tools often provide you with direct access to your personal data and allow you to effectively manage it.

Please note that Amer Sports may need to identify you and to ask for additional information in order to be able to fulfil your above requests. Please also note that applicable law may contain restrictions and other provisions that relate to your above rights.
